Welcome to USID documentation!
==============================
**Motivaton, specifications, implementation, and guidelines for the Universal Spectroscopic and Imaging Data (USID) model**

.. attention::

    If your data has a clear N-dimensional form, consider using
    `NSID <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyNSID/nsid.html>`_ and
    `pyNSID <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyNSID/about.html>`_
    as simpler and more user-friendly alternatives to USID and pyUSID.
