Frequently asked questions
==========================

What do you mean by multidimensional data?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please refer to our `nomenclature <./nomenclature.html>`_ document

Do you have APIs for creating and reading USID HDF5 files in languages besides python?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At the moment, we only have tools to read and write USID HDF5 files in python via our sister project - `pyUSID <../pyUSID/about.html>`_.
Given the open-source code of pyUSID and comprehensive documentation available, we believe that it should not be very challenging to work on USID HDF5 in other programming languages.
If you are interested in making an API available for other languages, we would be happy to help in any way we can. Please `get in touch with us <./contact.html>`_.

How can I reference USID?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please reference our `Arxiv <https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09515>`_ paper for now.
This manuscript was submitted to Advanced Structural and Chemical Imaging recently and is currently being peer-reviewed.
